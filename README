This is a multi-threaded CPU miner for M7/Cryptonite

Success is not guaranteed here. It mines blocks on testnet. Can be problems with
all threads maybe mining same nonce, overload of daemon. Anything.


YOU MUST SET THE EXTRANONCE PARAMETER IN THE CONF FILE TO BE ABLE TO MINE
WITH MULTIPLE MACHINES CONNECTED TO A SINGLE DAEMON. SEE exmaple-cfg.json
A DIFFERENT NONCE IS REQUIRED FOR **EACH** MINER

Your daemon should be 14072918 or better.
